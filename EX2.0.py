print(" John Radtke\n 1/20/17\n QUESTION:\n    At what size of a project should you start using version management software? \n RESPONSE:\n    After doing a little research on what version management software is and what it does. I have learned that the software allows many people to collaborate on the same coding project through repositories like GIT without permanently manipulating the same code. This is similar to how google docs let you share docs with others anywhere in the world, except without the backups. I could see software like this being necessary for any project, regardless of the size. I also believe it would be exponentially more important the higher the number of people your project will be built from. The ability to track and revert changes to your code is always a great organizational habit to train, especially if you have multiple other people manipulating, changing, and running tests on your code. I also think it would be impossible to have more than 50 people working on a set of code without using some version management software because of the sheer amount going on.  ")
