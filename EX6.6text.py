After reading through the document I have settled on the capitalize method. The capitalize method within python returns a copy of the original string with the first character capitalized and the rest of the characters still in lowercase. In my example, I create an input of any name and then I turned it into a string which I call str. capitalize on. It then prints this new version out as capitalized. I have noticed that the capitalization method only capitalizes the first word instead of many. If I wanted to capitalize the first character of every word in a string I would use the title method instead.  I could see how this method could be handy if I needed to only capitalize in certain situations like first names.
